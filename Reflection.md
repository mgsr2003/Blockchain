Working on this mini-blockchain gave me a concrete, hands-on understanding of hashing, immutability, and Proof-of-Work (PoW). 
I observed that a block’s hash is derived not only from its own contents but also from the previous block’s hash. 
Because each block references its predecessor’s fingerprint, any small change — for example modifying a transaction amount — changes that block’s hash and breaks the linkage, causing all subsequent blocks to fail validation. This chaining is the core mechanism that enforces immutability in blockchains.
